FRC 2025 Team 4150 startup and testing notes / to do list
=============================================

==========
Radios
==========
 - configure with newest firmware
 - configure a radio for the driver station.

==========
Spark Motor Controllers
==========
 - upload firmware
 - set to factory defaults
 - pick correct motor type
 - set CAN ID

==========
CanCoders
==========
 - update firmware
 - assign CAN IDs
 - read 0 position angle


==========
Drive
==========
 - Read zero position of CanCoders
	- set in begin
 - Measure horiz and vert distance between center of wheels
	- Set kinematics in begin
 - Determine which X,Y,Z IMU correspond to Roll, Pitch, Yaw.
	- Update DriveExecReadSensors
 - Verify operation of spin control with drive off the ground.
 - Verify distance driven after drive works..
	- If off, correct in drive begin.

==========
Climb
==========
 - CLIMB LOGIC needs work
	- can't just or all the limit switches together to set cancel
	- don't use sensor position for pull or reach.  
	- REST cmd is probably not needed.  
 - verify operation of limit switches.
	- they engage
	- they are labeled and used correctly.
 - verify current limit for NEO 550
	https://motors.vex.com/other-motors/neo550
	- Appears max current should be set between 25 and 30 amps.

 - set motor output to be low for both directions ( +/- 0.2 )
 - verify motor direction (+ = pull up)
 - reset motor output as needed.
 - verify climb works.
 - verify what motor encoder reads when extended and pulled in.
	(add a little to each and use as virtual limit switches.)

==========
Outer Elevator
==========
 - Verify limit switches
 - Verify and scale encoder
 - Verify direction of motor
 - Determine and set values for setpoints
 - Set motor outputs to be small
	- set control max output
 - Set elevator to middle of range.
 - Test, ......


==========
Inner Elevator
==========
 - Verify limit switches
 - Verify and scale encoder
 - Verify direction of motor
 - Determine and set values for setpoints
 - Set motor outputs to be small
	- set control max output
 - Set elevator to middle of range.
 - Ensure that lower limit of setpoint is set based on wrist position!!!!
 - Test, ......


==========
Intake
==========
 - Verify operation of Coral sensor
 - Verify operation of Algae sensor
 - Test Get Coral (don't feed coral)
 - Test Cancel
 - Test Get Coral
 - Test Deliver Coral
 - Test Get Algae
 - Test Deliver Algae
 - Update motor outputs for each action based on testing.

==========
Wrist
==========
 - WRIST logic needs work.
	- Make wrist ExecuteLogic VI.  (99% of Execute)
	- Add motor output to Execute
	- Add cmds
	- Add dash write (network)
	- Add dash read (if there is going to be dash tuning params)
 - Verify operation of abs encoder
 - Determine angle offset between raw encoder reading and desired angle
	- update code
 - Verify direction of motor.
	- reverse output if backwards.
 - Verify minimum allowed position based on inner elevator height.
	- inner elevator height has to work correctly first...
	- update if not valid.
 - Review initial tuning - set motor output to be slow to start.
 - Look at force needed to keep wrist at zero angle.  
	- Set gravity constant.
